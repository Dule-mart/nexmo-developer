# Add the Vonage .NET SDK

In your console, navigate into the `VonageSms` and run the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Vonage
```

You can now open the `VonageSms.csproj` file in Visual Studio. Alternatively you can open this whole folder in Visual Studio Code, however note that if you use VS Code you may need to take care of some of the scaffolding that Visual Studio does that is assumed by this tutorial.
